Things you'll need to get this up & running:

1) Twilio Account
   Sign up for twilio, get yourself and your whatsapp number verified. Activate your Whatsapp sandbox by the process shown
   on the website. Store your API credentials safely.

2) Heroku account
   Sign up for a free heroku account, create an app, name it anything you want. Also install heoku CLI. Store twilio API 
   credentials onto your heroku app so that the python script will be able to access it from the app. You can store your API 
   credentials by heading over to Settings > reveal config vars > add var. 

And then just deploy this git repository as it is onto your heroku app and you're good to go.
